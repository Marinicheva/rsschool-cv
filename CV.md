## About Myself

I'm 31 y.o. Since 2013 I have been working in supply (purchasing) department, since 2019 I have been on parental leave.
My introduction with front-end development and programming in general begun like a hobby from learning basics of python. But as I went deeper into this sphere, I started to understand that this is what I really like, this is the direction where I want to grow and become a professional. 

Recently my main **purpose** of studying is to get enough knowledge and experience to start career as front-end developer.
On the my way my best qualities, which I believe are my __strong sides__, help me:
1. Self-education skill;
2. Skill of perseverance to achieve my target.

But in same time I could move faster if my weak sides doesn't exist. How I think my _weak sides_ are:
- needs of communication, explanation and discussion. Sometimes I can't do something while I don't receive approved from someone. This problem I was able to minimize by online communities, that by the way led my to rs-school.
- wish of knowledge, wish of know as much as possible make me learn a lot of sources in the same time about the one topic. This situation entails confusion in my mind and I should to come back to the start of topic.

I believe that education in rs-school help me to reach my goal, teach me how to manage my strong and weak sides like a front-end developer.
